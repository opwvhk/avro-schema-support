Highlights documentation comments that are out of place.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
	Highlights documentation comments that don't belong to any declaration. This can be because they are immediately followed by another
	documentation comment, or because they are out of place (e.g., placed inside a declaration instead of before).
	Avro ignores such documentation comments, and may fail to parse them in the future.
