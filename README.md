<img align="right" height="160" src="src/main/resources/META-INF/pluginIcon.svg" alt="Pigeon Logo"/>IntelliJ plugin for Apache Avro™ Schema Support
===============================================

This plugin extends IntelliJ, PyCharm and other JetBrains IDEs to more easily work with Avro&trade; schemata and
protocols in both IDL format (<code>.avdl</code>) or JSON format (<code>.avsc</code> and <code>.avpr</code>).

Aside from file types, it features more comprehensive JSON schemata for the JSON formats than
the [JSON SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org/).

IDL features include:

* Syntax & error highlighting
* Code completion
* Formatting (configurable)
* Inspections and quick fixes
* Navigation, renaming, quote/brace pairs, etc.
* Converting Avro schemas/protocols from/to IDL
