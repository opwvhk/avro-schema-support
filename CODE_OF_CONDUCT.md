Code of Conduct
===============

Our Pledge
----------

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming and healthy community. Anyone who wants to contribute should feel welcome, and all of us contribute to that goal.


Our Standards
-------------

Harassment of any participant in any form will not be tolerated. Given the nature of this project,
we expect everyone to conduct themselves respectfully, and appropriate for a professional setting.

Behaviour that is especially welcome can be described as: kind, empathic, helpful, and above all
respectful.


Reporting Guidelines
-----------

While we should all adhere to this code of conduct, sometimes people may have a bad day, or be
unaware of how they come across. When that happens, please reach out in a respectful way.

Assume good faith; bad behaviour is more likely someone due to being unaware than intent. Should
there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, please reach out in confidence to
[the maintainer](mailto:from_github@westravanholthe.nl).
